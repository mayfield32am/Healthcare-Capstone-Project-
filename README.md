# Healthcare-Capstone-Project-
For this final career simulation, I was tasked with taking a healthcare dataset that was provided and performing end to end analytics. This included setting up a Lakehouse and Warehouse in Microsoft Fabric, using the tools in that Lakehouse such as notebook to clean the data and begin to set up our star schema. From there, the data was cleaned and uploaded into the data Warehouse and subsequently into Power BI to create visualizations and bring insight to the data. So, with that I chose to analyze the data from the point of view below: 
- Utilization and volume 
- Finances
-  Hospital performance
- Patient/Doctor demographics
